* carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) via [LI-840A (LICOR Biosciences)](https://www.licor.com/env/products/gas_analysis/LI-840A/)
* fine aerosols (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) via [DustTrak II (TSI Inc)](http://www.tsi.com/DUSTTRAK-II-Aerosol-Monitor-8530/)
* coarse aerosols (PM<sub>10</sub>) via DustTrak II (TSI Inc)
* weather conditions (T/P/RH/WS/WD) via [150WX (Airmar Technologies)](http://www.airmartechnology.com/weather-description.html?id=155)

> *N.B. The prototype PM, CO<sub>2</sub> and weather data sets are committed as
.zip files to limit overall repository size.*
